Do not confuse = (assignment operator) with == (comparison operator)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three logical operators: and, or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,\nx &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10 is true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or 3.\nFinally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not(x &gt; y) is true if x &gt; y is false; that is, if x is less than or equal to y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. If the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If the logical condition is false, the indented statement is skipped.\nif condition is True :\n    do the magic here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPAY ATTENTION TO INTENDATION!!!\nLuckily Python keeps the right intendention for you but be extra careful when writing longer scripts.\n\n\nPrint Correct if y is higher than 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there must be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a place holder for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement, which does nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed.\nif condition is True :\n    do the magic here\nelse :\n    do the other magic here\nPrint “Correct” if y is higher than 5. Otherwise, print “Incorrect”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches.

If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn’t have to be one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne conditional can also be nested within another.

Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.\nOne form of iteration in Python is the while statement.\nHere is a simple program that counts down from five and then says “Blastoff!”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flow of execution for a while statement is as follows:\n\nEvaluate the condition, yielding True or False.\nIf the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.\nIf the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.\n\nThis type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body of the loop an iteration. The loop above has five iterations.\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We call the variable that changes with each iteration the iteration variable.\nIf there is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\nbreak\nThe loop below an infinite loop because the logical expression on the while statement is simply the logical constant True:\nn = 10\nwhile True:\n    print(n, end=' ')\n    n = n - 1\nprint('Done!')\nIf you try to run it, it will run forever (if you lready have, go to Kernel menu and select Interrupt -.- )\nHowever, we can still use this pattern to build a useful loops as long as we add break to the body of the loop. It literally breaks the loop when we have reached the exit condition.\nFor example, the loop below will run until the user types done in the prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinue\nSometimes you are in an iteration of a loop and want to finish the current iteration and immediately jump to the next iteration. In that case you can use the continue statement to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration.\nHere is an extesnion of the previous code that copies its input until the user types “done”, but treats lines that start with the hash character as lines not to be printed (like Python comments). Try to run it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the lines are printed except the one that starts with the hash sign because when the continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to the while statement to start the next iteration, thus skipping the print statement.\n\n\nfor loops\nWhen we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have such a list of things to loop through, we can construct another type of loop using a for statement.\nWe call the while statement an indefinite loop - it simply loops until some condition becomes False.\nWe call the for loop a definite loop - it is loops through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set. Once it arrives to the end of the set, it stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfriends is a list - a set of three strings (we will talk about lists next week).\nThe for loop goes through the list and executes the body once for each of the elements in the list.\nfor and in are reserved words\nfriend is the iteration variable - it changes for each iteration of the loop"

In that case you can use the continue statement to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration.\nHere is an extesnion of the previous code that copies its input until the user types “done”, but treats lines that start with the hash character as lines not to be printed (like Python comments). Try to run it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the lines are printed except the one that starts with the hash sign because when the continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to the while statement to start the next iteration, thus skipping the print statement.\n\n\nfor loops\nWhen we want to loop through a set of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have such a list of things to loop through, we can construct another type of loop using a for statement.\nWe call the while statement an indefinite loop - it simply loops until some condition becomes False.\nWe call the for loop a definite loop - it is loops through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set. Once it arrives to the end of the set, it stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfriends is a list - a set of three strings (we will talk about lists next week).\nThe for loop goes through the list and executes the body once for each of the elements in the list.\nfor and in are reserved words\nfriend is the iteration variable - it changes for each iteration of the loop"
